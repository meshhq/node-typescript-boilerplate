Open sourcing Mesh Boilerplate

We start a lot of new software projects at Mesh. Whether we are kicking of a new project for a customer, or prototyping a new internal project, we need our engineers to get productive as quickly as possible. 

Modern applications unfortunately require a decent amount of configuration and setup before developers can start writting application code. In an effort to speed up this process, we have developer internal "boilerplate" project for several languages and development platforms. Today, we are very excited to open source two of those projects **react-redux-boiler-plate** and **node-typescript-boilerplate**. 

## React + Redux + Typescript

It is somewhat mindblowing how much project configuration and setup is need to get up and running with a react/redux project written in typescript. For starers, all three frameworks must be installed into an environment. Typescript mus then be configured via a tslint.config file. Webpack must be installed to transpiles Webpack code into vanilla js. 

## Express + Sequelize + Typescript

## Contributions Welcome 

While these boilerplate applications represent how Mesh reccomends projects be configured, we are always open to feedback and contributions from the broader development community. We welcome any and all pull requests.
